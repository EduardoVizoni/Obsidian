Column-Family Stores

# **Column-Family Stores***
Designed for massive-scale data, these databases organize information in columns rather than rows, optimizing write-heavy workloads. They distribute data efficiently across clusters, making them ideal for time-series data and applications requiring high availability. 

 # **Some examples**
 - [[Apache Cassandra]]
 - [[HBase]]
