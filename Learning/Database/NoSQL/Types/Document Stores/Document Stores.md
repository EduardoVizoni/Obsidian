Documents Stores

---

# **Document Store**
These databases store data in flexible, schema-less documents (usually JSON, BSON, or XML). Unlike SQLâ€™s rigid tables, each document can have a different structure, making them perfect for evolving data models. They support indexing and some querying features, suiting content management, user profiles, and catalogs. 

# **Some examples**
- [[MongoDB]]
- [[CouchDB]]
