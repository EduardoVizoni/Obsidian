# **Lombok Summary**
**Lombok** is a [[Java]] library that **reduces boilerplate code** through compile-time annotations. Integrated with [[Spring Boot]], it automatically generates [[Getters]], [[Setters]], [[Constructors]], and other repetitive code during compilation, keeping your classes clean and maintainable.
