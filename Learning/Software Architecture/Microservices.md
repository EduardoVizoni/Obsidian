Microservices

---

[[Microservices]] are a architectural style pattern that composed an application in small, independents and loosely couple services. Where each service has a single function, runs in its own process and can be deployed independently, they communicate via lightweight request protocols(like HTTP). 

This architectural style coexists with other software design approaches at [[Software Architecture]] like:

- **[[M.V.C]]**: Used _inside_ a microservice to organize code (like a [[Java]] [[Spring Boot]] class).
		   
- **[[S.O.A]]**: An older, similar idea, but microservices are **smaller and simpler**.
	
- **[[S.O.L.I.D Principle]]**: Rules to keep code clean (e.g., "one job per service").
	
- **[[O.O.P]]**: A coding style (using classes/objects) often used to write microservices.
