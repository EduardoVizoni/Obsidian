**Model-View-Controller**

---

# **Overview**

MVC is a **software organize pattern** that separates an application into three main interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps manage complexity in large applications, promotes organized code, and makes applications easier to maintain and scale. In [[Software Architecture]], its common using the MVC with other methods, like [[S.O.A]] and [[S.O.L.I.D Principle]], we can use it in [[O.O.P]] projects that need a better architecture and organization.

- **Model**: Manages data and business logic.
    
- **View**: Handles the user interface.
    
- **Controller**: Processes user input and mediates between Model and View.
    

**Key Benefit**: Clean separation of concerns, making applications easier to maintain, test, and scale.
